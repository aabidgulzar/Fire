        In the faint glow of a single match, the world shrinks to a trembling circle of light. Shadows stretch long and restless, whispering secrets into the dark, while the flame dances with a fragile defiance against the void. Every flicker feels alive, as though it carries the memory of firestorms and forgotten suns, yet here it isâ€”delicate, fleeting, and mortal. The air hums with silence, broken only by the faint crackle of burning wood, as if the flame itself is breathing. Beyond its fragile glow lies endless uncertainty, but within its reach there is warmth, clarity, and the strange comfort of something so small daring to fight against the endless night.
